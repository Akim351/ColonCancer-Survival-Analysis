ColonCancer-Survival-Analysis

- This project explores survival outcomes of 566 patients who underwent surgery for colon or rectal cancer between 1958 and 1978 at a single hospital. 
- Using Python, the analysis employs exploratory data analysis (EDA), Kaplan-Meier survival curves, Cox proportional hazards models, and logistic regression to identify clinical and demographic factors influencing post-operative survival. The dataset includes variables such as age, sex, Dukes stage, tumor location, and symptoms like weight loss and ileus.
- This analysis aims to uncover survival patterns and risk predictors to support future clinical decision-making.
